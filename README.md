# Salvone

This is part of a batch of projects I made available to the public because they are no longer in active development, and/or are too unfinished or broken to be considered useful to me.

Salvone possibly has the most work done out of all, but it's definitely not the best code I've ever written. Salvone is supposed to be an alternative for factions that I was going to use for personal reasons. Feel free to study whatever I have here, however, most of it shouldn't be actually used in production unless you modify it heavily.
